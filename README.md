# About me

My name is Angel, or at least that's what it translates to.
I am half Greek, half Russian, although I barely know Russian.

My favorite programming language is C. I also use Python
and Java, depends.

Except of computer science and programming, my hobbies
are literally too many to be listed here. The most important
are learning GNU/Linux, Science (With most of its subjects obviously),
and sleeping.

I have developed various programs, but none of them made it
to the public. The best of them was probably the Blackhole installer,
which long story short, it would automatically install a desktop environment,
utilities, games and much more within Termux. I abandoned it because distributing
was hard and custom installations just feel better. I might start it again though.

That's all of it, I guess. Check the repos weekly if you install any of my programs,
I update them and let people clone them directly.
