I've made the Who Am I.txt file for people that want to know me better.
So if that's the case, have a look at it.

Here I write some code notes in a form of mathematical code,
to remember each time I code.

You can use this code, if you understand it, to make
notes for yourself. It isn't a programming language though.

# BEGIN

<dec var 144> // declares the type of code we will store, in this case C
c_inc 5944 $ 5845 $ 5746 & // this means we will include stdlib, stdio and other files (C)
0000 (#) 2944 // declares entry point
*

// From now on, no letters will be used. Only
// numbers. So it will be difficult to understand in
// raw form.
