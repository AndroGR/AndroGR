Hi. I'm Angel.
I am a 15 year old that writes programs in C, 
Java, or Python. I sometimes study other languages, 
but these are the "main" ones.

My ethnicity is both Greek and Russian. I don't
know any Russian through, because I was born and
grown up in Greece. I should learn it someday, I guess.

Although only my programming side is shown here, 
I actually like studying chemistry, physics, biology,
and much more. 

(You might think I look like a nerd or something,
but actually I'm not, I only study whenever I feel
to and I don't think it's important).

The reason I chose the languages I know is simple.

C would certainly help me have a good understanding about
programming. Also, C would be the key of developing
something big (When I started learning C, I only knew Python, so
I really needed a language closer to the machine).

Python is the exact opposite of C, it actually reminds you
like speaking English. It's the easiest language you
can learn, but it's very limited to websites and normal,
everyday usage apps, nothing more.

Java was just the intermediate of these two. If I wanted something
quick but powerful, which also reminds you of the average
programming language, then learn some Java.

I also know some x86 assembly and HTML, but I barely
know even the basics.

That's all of me, at least for the public. I'd also state
that I like memes, but my humor is way too weird to understand it.

END (Got the joke? 'END', like in Pascal...yeah...anyways.)
